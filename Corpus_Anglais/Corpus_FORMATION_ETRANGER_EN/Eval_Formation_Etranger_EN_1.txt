I completed a master's program in intelligent information systems over the past two years. I didnâ€™t particularly enjoy the first semester of my first year because it was mainly a core curriculum shared across all specializations, with many common modules like Compilation 2 and Operating Systems 2. This resulted in a lack of specialization. However, starting from the second semester and especially in the second year, we began to focus more on specialization with modules such as data analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and information retrieval. We used Python for the practical work in these modules.

One downside was that the modules were not sufficiently updated, especially given the recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly with language models (LLMs) and generative AI.
