After obtaining my bachelor's degree in Algeria and coming to France to pursue my master's degree, I found the quality of the training I received to be highly satisfactory. It enabled me not only to acquire the basics of complex computer systems, but also to solve concrete problems in this field. The teachers were always on hand to encourage and motivate students to constantly innovate and express their creativity in developing new ideas. Overall, the training was excellent. One could only say that its weak point lies in its predominantly practical orientation, with less theoretical depth. Some will see this as an advantage, others as a drawback.
