I took part in the BUT Informatique diploma at the IUT in Reims. The course lasted 3 years. During the course, we learned the basics of the different areas covered by IT. We learned different programming languages such as HTML, Python and PHP. We were also taught system development, starting with bash commands and then using tools such as Git and Docker. Maths also had its place in the program, with courses on probability, graphs, automata, encryption and more. The course also introduced us to database tools, with modeling techniques such as Merise and UML, as well as a data manipulation language with SQL. BUT also offered a number of communication and English courses, which are just as important as the technical ones. In the 2nd year, 2 courses were offered, one focusing on web development and the other on data processing, plus an 8 to 12-week internship. In 3rd year, it was possible to follow a sandwich course. The main positive points of this program are its many practical work placements, enabling students to put all the lessons into practice. The professionalism of the course, with an internship and a work-study program, is a major plus. The teachers are highly competent and available to answer students' questions. Last but not least, the course includes a great deal of group work, enabling students to develop the human skills they will need in the professions of the future. The negative points of this course are that the networks and cybersecurity courses were lacking to provide a global vision of what IT is. I also found that the communication courses were a little too numerous, even though I don't doubt their usefulness.
