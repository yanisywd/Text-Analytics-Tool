The BUT Informatique is a 3-year professional training program that enables students to move into all IT professions, through dozens of modules as varied as they are relevant.
In the first year, the aim is to discover the different components of the IT field. The first modules will focus on the basics of programming, database design and construction, and the fundamentals of computer systems and networks.
In the second year, students have the opportunity to specialize. In Reims, students can choose between 2 courses, the first focusing on application development, particularly web applications: Application Development; and the second focusing on data analysis and artificial intelligence: Data Administration, Management and Exploitation. This specialization is valid right up to the end of the third year, and gives real added value to the profile of students who wish to enter the job market as soon as they finish their BUT.
There are several reasons why this training program is professionalizing. Firstly, the program integrates various modules such as communication, technical and professional English, project management, business management and the Personal and Professional Project (PPP). These modules will enable students to complete a compulsory internship lasting at least three months.
