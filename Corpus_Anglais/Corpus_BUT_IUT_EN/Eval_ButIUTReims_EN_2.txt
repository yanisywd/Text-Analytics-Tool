During the last three years before joining this master's program, I completed a Bachelor's in IT at the IUT of Reims. My training began in September 2021 and ended in July 2024. 
Throughout this program, I covered many areas of computer science, ranging from databases to understanding how networks work. Several of these courses were interesting. However, after some reflection, others were not particularly useful.
Regarding the positive aspects of the program, we had competent professors. I would like to thank Mrs. Sandron and Mr. Blanchard for the practical and tutorial sessions they conducted. Overall, the classes really made us want to work and take an interest in the subject.
On the negative side, there was some repetition, particularly in the web development section, which did not allow for learning much new content. Additionally, some sections on AI were too vague and lacked precision.
In conclusion, I would say it was a good program. It covered many areas and provided a solid foundation, although some aspects could still be improved.
