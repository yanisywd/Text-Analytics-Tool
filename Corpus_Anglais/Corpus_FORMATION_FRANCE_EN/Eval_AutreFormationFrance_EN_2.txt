The BUT in computer science, Deployment of Communicating and Secure Applications course at Aix-Marseille University, is an extremely enriching training, both intellectually and humanly, without forgetting the professional skills it provides.


* First year :


During the first year, we covered the general basics of computer science, covering areas such as computer development (front-end and back-end), databases, modeling languages, as well as a little mathematics. This year allows us to lay solid foundations in the various aspects of computer science.


* Second year :


I chose to specialize in the Deployment of Communicating and Secure Applications course. We started with an introduction to cybersecurity, while continuing to deepen general computer science concepts such as databases. This year also included a 2-month internship and a SAE (Learning and Evaluation Situation), a structuring project that allowed us to put our knowledge into practice.


* Third year : 


The final year is more specialized, with an in-depth study of cybersecurity, cloud computing concepts, and optimization. This year, we also carried out a SAE in collaboration with Master of Digital Art students, which strengthened our ability to work as a team on cross-disciplinary projects. A 4-month internship crowns this year, thus completing our training in a concrete and professional way.


* Positive points of the training :


- Acquisition of specialized technical skills
- Development of practical skills through projects and internships
- Diversity of courses (Law, Entrepreneurship, Cybersecurity, etc.)
- Strengthening of project management skills
- Importance of practical work (TP), promoting learning through experience


* Negative points :


- Complexity of content, sometimes dense and technical
- Poor organization on the part of the IUT, due to the fact that it was the first year of BUT 3


* Conclusion :


I am very satisfied with having followed this course. I learned a lot and this degree allowed me to continue my studies with a solid foundation and valuable practical experience.
