During my three years of undergraduate studies in Tours (2021-2024), I had the opportunity to receive a solid education in computer science. The courses were, for the most part, well-taught by competent professors who were passionate about their field and always ready to share their knowledge with students.

However, several disadvantages became apparent over the years. Firstly, the material resources, such as laboratories and technological tools, were not always up to date. For example, some of the software used was outdated, which sometimes limited certain learning and practical experimentation opportunities. Moreover, while final-year projects were an excellent way to apply the knowledge acquired, the guidance provided by the university was occasionally insufficient, leaving students to figure out complex problems on their own, which could be discouraging for some.

Furthermore, the degree, although comprehensive, was quite general and did not adequately prepare students for specialized paths, such as those related to data science, artificial intelligence, etc. I would have appreciated having more specific modules, such as those on artificial intelligence or data analysis, included in the program. It is also worth noting that there were few opportunities for students to participate in international exchange programs or to take courses in English. This lack of opportunities limited students' exposure to a global perspective, which is crucial in a field like computer science where skills must be competitive on an international scale.

Finally, the university could have benefited from stronger partnerships with local or national companies. Such collaborations could have offered more internships or projects directly related to current job market needs. This would have not only helped students better understand professional expectations but also allowed them to build a valuable network for their future careers.
