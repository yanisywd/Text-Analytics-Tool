My computer science degree course at Reims was very enriching in many ways. Firstly, in terms of computer science and mathematics knowledge. For the most part, the various subjects were consistent with the course objectives. However, some subjects were not very pleasant to follow, such as INFO0402, INFO0503 and INFO0603. In terms of course organization, the two people in charge, Mr Rabat and Mr Deslile, did a very good job of managing the license, whether in terms of timetabling, disseminating important information, managing the various exams or visualizing grades (Thor). Nevertheless, some teachers were not necessarily very involved in their subjects throughout the course. The university's infrastructure sometimes left something to be desired. In particular, the various pre-fabricated rooms, broken chairs, tps rooms and rooms that don't provide sockets for each student. Nevertheless, my overall opinion of the course is very positive and I'm very happy to have completed my degree here in Reims. And I'm also happy to be continuing my IT Masters at the same school.
