Overall, my previous training was fine, the easy access to the program thanks to Moodle and in general the practical courses were a real plus point. The number of hours was well managed and the courses were mastered by the teachers. The atmosphere was great, especially in 3rd year, where we really helped each other to succeed. In terms of negative points, the 2nd year was a horrible experience, between the increasing difficulty and the majority of the teachers who didn't seem to give a damn about teaching us new notions or who were reluctant to show that they were better than us in terms of skills (which is true, but you should teach us the subjects instead of saying that). Those years were just horrible in every way. To solve this problem, I think we would have needed more practical work to better understand the way things work, and maybe change the teachers. But to sum up, the training was cool to do, I was able to blossom in life on my own with a subject I really enjoy learning about, and I hope the Master's will be the same or even better.
