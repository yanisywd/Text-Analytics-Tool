I did a degree in computer science at the University of Reims. During these 3 years, I was able to discover many different subjects. In fact, the content of the course is very varied, enabling me to explore the different areas of computer science, such as programming, algorithms, databases, networks, etc., so that I could decide what I wanted to specialize in later on. Personally, I liked the database modules, although I found them too simplistic. On the other hand, I didn't really appreciate the network and system administration subjects, although I did find them affordable for students. 
The level of the degree increases progressively. The first year allows you to define the basics and brush up on mathematics. There's a turning point between L1 and L2, with L2 being much more technical and perhaps the most difficult year. L3 is a continuation of the previous years. 
The degree is slightly more theoretical than practical, which suited me personally but may have been a bit disappointing for others. Practical work was often interesting, but sometimes boring or too complex for the course.
All in all, I had a good time and got good results, and the teachers were friendly and educational.
