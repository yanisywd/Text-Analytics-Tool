During my three years studying for a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, I had the opportunity to follow a fairly diversified programme, touching on many programming languages. Although the approach was often superficial, it did provide an overview that enabled students to better identify their areas of interest for future specialisation. Although the course was taught by passionate and committed lecturers, it sometimes suffered from structural problems: a glaring lack of resources and a muddled organisation due to administrative malfunctions. Some modules seemed irrelevant to future practice.

Material conditions also left much to be desired, with buildings that were poorly insulated and poorly equipped. On a more personal level, I often found myself at odds with the highly theoretical approach of the degree, as I am more attracted by the practical aspect. Many hours were devoted to modelling or theoretical concepts that didn't captivate me. The few coding projects were, for me, below what I had hoped for.

However, I was really interested in some of the practical courses, particularly those relating to networks and the introductions to the ASR and CHPS masters degrees. These courses, with a focus on IT security and development on Unity, really motivated me.
